## English

Most part of my experience includes work for trade companies.  
My previous company has many **subsidiary** (filial) around Russian.  
I implemented software for building management system, financial analysis 
and warehouse management system (WMS).

At the beginning, we used asp.net framework for the backend side which mssql for a database.  
For the frontend side, we used razor and jquery.  
2 years ago we moved to vue.js  

Also, I developed software for WMS (warehouse management system).
This one is used for an account for excise stamps.  
We used Laravel, Postgres and vanilla JS.
